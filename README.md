# Aph

A very lightweight (**976 bytes** minified and gzipped), simple and easy-to-use DOM manipulation library.

**'a', 'p', 'h'** are the first letters of **Apheleia**, the greek mythology spirit and personification of ease, simplicity and primitivity in the good sense.

The goal of this library is to be a versatile and lightweight way of doing some simple DOM manipulations with vanilla JS. In no way it tries to replace any other framework such as jQuery, Zepto, Cash, etc.

**aph** uses ES6 module syntax for ease of importing it inside your code. For those concatenating scripts or including directly into the HTML, there's also an [Universal Module Definition version available](https://github.com/kaisermann/aph/tree/master/dist/aph.js).
